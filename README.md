# json-patch-extended

An extended version of JSON Patch (RFC 6902)

JSON Patch is an incredibly useful way of describing and managing changes between JSON objects. It lacks, however, a number of features that prevent it from allowing truly atomic operations. Testing whether a member exists on an object, for instance, is not possible with vanilla JSON Patch. JSON Patch Extended is strictly a superset of JSON patch.
